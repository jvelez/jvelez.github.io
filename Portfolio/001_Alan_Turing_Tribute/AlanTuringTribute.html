    <p style="font-size:18px">Because of his contributions to the field, Alan Turing is considered by many to be the father of modern computer  science. He formed the concept of the algorithms and computations with one of his inventions, the Turing machine.
    </p><br>
  
<ul>
     
<li>
Designed the programming system of the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available electronic digital computer.
</li><br>
     
<li>
A pioneer of Artificial Intelligence. He believed that computers would be able to learn and devised the Turing Test, to test if a computer was really intelligent. No computer has passed the test, as yet.
</li><br>
     
<li>
He was awarded the OBE in 1945 for services to the country in wartime, most of what he did would not be made public for another 30 years.
</li><br>
     
<li>
Inventor of the Turing Machine in 1935. All modern stored-programme digital computers are based on this invention.
</li><br>
     
<li>
Integral to the building of The Bombe. Polish scientists had invented a device known as a 'Bomba', Alan took their early versions and made it into an electro-mechanical machine which helped in the breaking of the Enigma code used by the German forces.
</li><br>
  
<li>
His work enabled the Enigma to be decoded - By early 1942, the team at Bletchley Park were decoding up to 39,000 Enigma messages a month. Eventually this number rose to 84,000 or about two messages decoded every minute.
</li><br>
  
<li>
Member of the team which decoded the 'Fish' cipher. Which was used by the German High Command to transmit messages between Hitler and senior officers.
